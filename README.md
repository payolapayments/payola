Payments with Stripe for your Rails application.

## What does this do?

Payola is a drop-in Rails engine that lets you sell one or more products by just including a module in your models. It includes:

* An easy to embed, easy to customize, async Stripe Checkout button
* Asynchronous payments, usable with any background processing system
* Full webhook integration
* Easy extension hooks for adding your own functionality
* Customizable emails

To see Payola in action, check out the site for [Mastering Modern Payments: Using Stripe with Rails](https://www.masteringmodernpayments.com). Read the book to find out the whys behind Payola's design.

## Installation

Add Payola to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'payola-payments', :git => 'git@github.com:payolapayments/payola.git'
```

Run the installer:

```bash
$ rails g payola:install
$ rake db:migrate
```

(**Note**: do not run `rake payola:install:migrations`. Payola's migrations live inside the gem and do not get copied into your application.)

Optionally, tell Stripe about your application. Add this as a webhook in your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks):

```
https://your.website.example.com/payola/events
```

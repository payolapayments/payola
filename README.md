Payments with Stripe for your Rails application.

## What does this do?

Payola is a drop-in Rails engine that lets you sell one or more products by just including a module in your models. It includes:

* An easy to embed, easy to customize, async Stripe Checkout button
* Asynchronous payments, usable with any background processing system
* Full webhook integration
* Easy extension hooks for adding your own functionality
* Customizable emails

To see Payola in action, check out the site for [Mastering Modern Payments: Using Stripe with Rails](https://www.masteringmodernpayments.com). Read the book to find out the whys behind Payola's design.

It also comes with priority support and a lawyer-friendly commercial license. You can see all of the details on the [Payola Pro homepage](https://www.payola.io/pro).
